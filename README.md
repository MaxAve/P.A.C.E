# P.A.C.E (Pretty Awful Chess Engine)
### Description
PACE is my second attempt at making a chess engine. My first attempt (repo is MaxAve/NerdChess) has been mostly a failure as it performs extremely poorly, reaching a depth of about 2 moves (4 half-moves) with decent computation time. Now I am trying to make a better and faster chess engine. I am sure PACE will be awful, but hopefully better than my first attempt as I have learned much about optimization when developing NerdChess.
